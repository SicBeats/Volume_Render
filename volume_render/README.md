This volume rendering assignment covers the basic requirements specified for
the volume rendering project. I did not implement any of the "Ways to Earn
Additional Points".

This was a challenging project, but I believe it helped to expand
my knowledge of interpolation and vtk rendering. As well as ray casting.

I used the astro64.vtk and astro512.vtk files.

Thank you.
